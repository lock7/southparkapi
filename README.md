<H1>Team Mouse South Park API Project</H1>
<H2>Welcome to our API where you can access information on a fair few characters from South Park. You can see images of your favourite characters.<br>

<H3>The animated series of 297 episodes is not for children. In fact, its goal seems to be to offend as many as possible as it presents the adventures of Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman. The show has taken on Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, politicians of every stripe and self-important celebrities. Oh, and Kenny is killed in many episodes.</H3></p>
<p>You can access character names, images, type, age, occupations and quotes. </p>
